## A. Introduction

**PSEDB** is an unofficial database that holds a list of **Registered Electronic System Operators (PSE/ESO)** in the Republic of Indonesia, as first regulated through the **Law by Ministry of Communication and Informatics of Republic of Indonesia No. 5 Year 2020**, originally titled as the law for *Penyelenggara Sistem Elektronik Lingkup Privat*. We only collect and process data about the **Electronic System Operators (PSE/ESO)** and their operating **Electronic Systems** as registered through the applicable legal process.

## B. Copyright Acknowledgement of Electronic System Operator Data Source

The data collected and processed on **PSEDB** are directly sourced from the **Government of the Republic of Indonesia** (hereby referred as the **Government**) through the **Ministry of Communication and Informatics of Republic of Indonesia** (*Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika Republik Indonesia*). Hence, it possible for the sourced data, at any times, to be protected by **Copyright** on behalf of the Government or an appointed Government entity to manage the administration and policing of Electronic Systems through applicable laws.

We decided to collect and process the copyrightable **Electronic System Operator Data** through the Fair Use clauses in Indonesian copyright laws, specifically **Republic of Indonesia Law No. 28 Year 2014**, through the Fair Use intent of "safety and governance, legislative, and judicial purposes". Citing the original Indonesian source,

> **Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 28 Tahun 2014** Tentang Hak Cipta, Pasal 44 Ayat (1)b
> 
>> (1) Penggunaan, pengambilan, Penggandaan, dan/atau pengubahan suatu Ciptaan dan/atau produk Hak Terkait secara seluruh atau sebagian yang substansial tidak dianggap sebagai pelanggaran Hak Cipta jika sumbernya disebutkan atau dicantumkan secara lengkap untuk keperluan:
>> 
>> b. **keamanan serta penyelenggaraan pemerintahan, legislatif, dan peradilan;**

We establish this database to allow users, including legally-registered Electronic System Operators, to monitor and fulfill their legal obligations to operate as a legally-registered Electronic System Operator (ESO). Due to copyright concerns, we advise Users of this Electronic System to include a **Copyright Acknowledgement** to **General Directorate of Informatics Applications of Ministry of Communication and Informatics of Republic of Indonesia** (Direktorat Jenderal Aplikasi Informatika Kementerian Komunikasi dan Informatika Republik Indonesia) when distributing copies of PSE/ESO data as processed on PSEDB.

## C. Collection of Data from Registered Electronic System Operator Database

We generally collect and process **Registered Private Sector Electronic System Operator (ESO)** from the official national database by the **Ministry of Communication and Informatics of Republic of Indonesua** (`https://pse.kominfo.go.id`), including certain types of data that may be entitled to **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** including (but not limited to):

* name, and
* website address,

of the **owner, developer, and/or operator of the Registered Electronic System** by legal process. The Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in regards to the owner, developer, and/or operator may belong to an individual or a legal entity.

The **PSEDB** database system is also designed to store **Historical Data** about the identity and registration status for Electronic System Operators (ESO), making it **difficult to remove such Personally Identifiable Information (PII) once recorded in the database**. The developer of the PSEDB database system have taken great care to limit the amount of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about the Registered Electronic System Operator as an attempt to protect their privacy.

The **PSEDB Electronic System** automatically collects, stores, uses, copies, and distributes the Registered Electronic System Operator data to all of our users, especially for purposes as recommended on Section **B. Copyright Acknowledgement of Electronic System Operator Data Source**. We also assume that each **Registered Electonic System Operator (ESO)** have understood their legal obligations and consequences of revealing their **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** to the public when registering themselves according to the legal process applicable in the Republic of Indonesia.
