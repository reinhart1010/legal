# Formatting Conventions for Official Agreements, Certificates, and Letters (ACL)

Reinhart Previano Koentjoro and Citra Manggala Dirgantara are Indonesian legal entities whose are bound by Indonesian legal conventions. To ensure compatibility with Indonesian legal processing standards as well as document tracking and archival systems, we closely follow the Indonesian legal standards of formal letter writing, while introducing additional measures to improve the letter-reading experience for recipients, as well as to protect the authenticity of the documents.

## Paper Sizes

Unless explicitly required by the recipient(s), we commonly use **A4** or **A5** paper sizes depending on the following purposes.

| No | Criterion | Preferred Size |
|---|:-:|
| 11 | Paper letters for private sets of recipients | A4 |
| 12 | Paper letters for up to 5 (five) sets of public recipients *and* up to 25 (twenty five) physical copies | A4 |
| 13 | Paper letters for more than 5 (five) public sets of recipients *and* 25 (twenty five) physical copies | **A5** or scaled A5 on A4 |
| 21 | Electronic documents that are intended to be distributed and/or archived through physical media (e.g. certificates, contracts, as well as letters through faximile) | A4 |
| 22 | Electronic documents that are intended to be distributed and/or archived through digital media (e.g. emails and social media posts) | *A5* |

> Reinhart Previano Koentjoro and Citra Manggala Dirgantara are committed towards reducing paper waste and improve the digital experience to support the human physical health. Using an A5-sized documents may improve our customers’ and recipients’ reading experience through mobile screens, and reduce the amount of papers required to distribute our letters.

## Date and Time

The Indonesian standards for formatting date and time are `DD/MM/YYYY` and `hh.mm`, respectively. To resolve formatting disputes with other countries’ standards, we only use different conventions when issuing these documents for different languages and regions.

| No | Criterion | Date Format | Time Format |
|:-:|---|---|---|
| 00 | This document is exempt from the remaining criteria | `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO standard) | `hh:mm` (ISO standard) |
| 11 | This document is written in Indonesian language (*Bahasa Indonesia*) | `DD/MM/YYYY` | `hh.mm` |
| 12 | This document is written in Chinese, Chinese-based (e.g. Cantonese), Japanese, or Korean language | `YYYY.MM.DD` | `hh:mm` |
| 21 | This document is primarily written for at least 1 (one) recipient based on United States | `MMMM DDth, YYYY` (e.g. October 10th, 2001) | `hh:mm` |
| 22 | This document is primarily written for at least 1 (one) recipient based on Asian countries legally recognizing Chinese, Chinese-based (e.g. Cantonese), Japanese, and/or Korean language(s) for formal communications | `YYYY.MM.DD` | `hh:mm` |

We will use the `00` criterion (ISO-standard date and time formatting) for documents which might be intended for electronic entry, such as certificates, and to support languages and regions which are not covered by remaining criteria.
